# GCP

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) makes it easy for you to provide serverless compute to dragondrop's container.

1\) Define a [Cloud Run Job](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/create-jobs)

2\) Provide the API endpoint to you [job definition](../../getting-started/creating-a-job.md). Done!



_Coming Soon:_ Terraform Module to automate the provisioning of the resources needed to use dragondrop within GCP.
