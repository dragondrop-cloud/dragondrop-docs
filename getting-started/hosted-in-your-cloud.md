# Hosted in Your Cloud

To provide you with the best possible security, all dragondrop customers (including those using our forever free tier!) deploy dragondrop's code into their own cloud environment.

This lets the analysis of your current cloud run with no information about your cloud posture or Terraform ever hitting our servers.

Because dragondrop is delivered through a containerized executable, all that is needed within your cloud is serverless compute capable of running a container, along with an HTTPS endpoint that dragondrop can make calls to for invoking said serverless compute.

For more details on deployment of the dragondrop container into your environment, please see [Deploying To Your Cloud](broken-reference).
