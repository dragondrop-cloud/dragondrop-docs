# What is a Job?

A Job is a single instance of a [cloud-concierge](https://github.com/dragondrop-cloud/cloud-concierge) container deployed within your cloud environment. During execution, the container will scan your cloud environment and output identified, relevant results via a Pull Request into your Version Control System of choice.
